# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly, even when the syntax appears correct.

## Problem

The provided code uses Tailwind CSS classes for background color (`bg-red-500`) and hover effect (`hover:bg-blue-700`). However, these classes do not render as expected.  The text remains unaffected by the classes.

## Solution

The problem is related to the improper configuration or build process.  Ensure that your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is properly configured to include the necessary files (such as your main CSS file) and that you run the build process correctly to generate the necessary CSS output.   It is also important to verify the content of the file where your tailwind styles are imported and that there are no syntax errors.
